            follow the proper design principles that we were taught. We started by researching the UI of the best CCTV monitoring software 
            that exists nowadays. After listing their strengths and weaknesses we knew what we had to include in our own software and what to avoid. 
            We prepared the initial sketches shown further down in the report and handed it out to our classmates. We got the feedback from them in order
             to produce the second iteration of drawings and finally end up to our prototype version. 
            This last one was produced on a pc using Adobeâ€™s Photoshop in order to achieve the highest quality graphics.</p>
