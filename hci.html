            <p class="text-white-50" style="text-align: justify;">Camden London Borough Council is the local authority for the London Borough of Camden in London, England. The capital of the United Kingdom, London, consists of 32 borough councils one of them is Camden Council. Camden is divided into 18 wards, each electing three councillors.

            <br>The council was created by the London Government Act 1963 and replaced three local authorities: Hampstead Metropolitan Borough Council, Holborn Metropolitan Borough Council and St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council.

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > The project assigned to our team is called CCTV Analysis with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and our client is the Camden Council. With more than 4 million cameras installed in the whole United Kingdom, Camden has a large number of CCTVs that need monitoring. Due to the lack of personnel in the CCTV monitoring section of Camden Council, they decided to use a software that will help in the analysis of the CCTV footage. The system we were asked to build should have AI and ML (Machine Learning) embedded in it. This will help in making it better over time so that it can be used on its own in the near future. The major requirement of this system is to analyse the footage and notify the users in case of any anti-social behaviour. The project was supposed to be a continuation of last year's master students but several changes were made by the client so we decided to develop the software in our own new way.</p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > Due to the complexity of the project the client made clear from the first meeting that they do not expect a high end working software that will predict accurately any possible case of anti-social behaviour. They explained that the project goal is to build something simple which works, test it for a few years and then develop it further over the years in order to reach the end goal of monitoring the CCTVs solely using this software. The client wants us to create a software that will recognize all the people inside a video, i.e. unlimited number of people at the same time. In addition, understand some of their basic actions, like standing, sitting or lying on a bench.</p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > Gathering the requirements of this project was accomplished by establishing a close cooperation with our client. We held regular meetings almost every Monday in the client's offices near Kings Cross Station. Other than the meetings held any questions raised as we worked on the project during the week were answered by the client using emails. Every two weeks we were asked to write a Progress Report which was also send to the client by the team leader. In this way the client could keep track of our progress and guide us in case of any fault. Since there was only one requirement made by the client our requirement gathering process was really easy. We made a few suggestions to the client for adding extra features in the software. Since these features were considered as extra by the client we stored them in the Could Have area of the MoSCoW requirements list. </p>

			<br>- Traditionally, CCTV operators have to look through each camera, so that they know which camera needs attention.
