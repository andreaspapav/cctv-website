          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > The project assigned to our team is called CCTV Analysis with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and our client is the Camden Council. With more than 4 million cameras installed in the whole United Kingdom, Camden has a large number of CCTVs that need monitoring. Due to the lack of personnel in the CCTV monitoring section of Camden Council, they decided to use a software that will help in the analysis of the CCTV footage. The system we were asked to build should have AI and ML (Machine Learning) embedded in it. This will help in making it better over time so that it can be used on its own in the near future. The major requirement of this system is to analyse the footage and notify the users in case of any anti-social behaviour.</p>

They explained that the project goal is to build something simple which works, test it for a few years and then develop it further over the years in order to reach the end goal of monitoring the CCTVs solely using this software. The client wants us to develop the CCTV AI which can recognise items, human and postures of the people. Since the government has their own monitoring UI, they do not require us to build a user interface, but build something in order to let them know that the CCTV AI is working.</p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > Gathering the requirements of this project was accomplished by establishing a close cooperation with our client. We held regular meetings almost every Monday in the client's offices near Kings Cross Station. Other than the meetings held any questions raised as we worked on the project during the week were answered by the client using emails. Every two weeks we were asked to write a Progress Report which was also send to the client by the team leader. In this way the client could keep track of our progress and guide us in case of any fault. Since there was only one requirement made by the client our requirement gathering process was really easy. We made a few suggestions to the client for adding extra features in the software. Since these features were considered as extra by the client we stored them in the Could Have area of the MoSCoW requirements list. </p>
