          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" ><b><u>Web Application</u></b>:
            <br>
          In here, we will test its compatibility and the performance. As we mentioned in the design section, we have two web applications which are hosted in AzureVM and local. We will test if all the functionalities from them can be used in different web browser. In terms of performance, we will use <b>FireFox</b> to test how fast the image recognition can process based on different types of input(image, video and live-streaming).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Image Recognition:</u></b></p>

            <li>Posture Recognition</li>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">In the design session, we can see that only the Item Recognition is an API, and others are SDK. The Item Recognition is using Google Vision API, therefore, there is no need to test its accuracy.
            <br>
            <br>
          For Face and Posture Recognition, we will apply unit and integration testing to them. In unite and integration testing, we will describe how we create the models, select the best model and test the model selected.
            <br>
            <br>
          Finally, we will list out the compatibility of each recognition for each input type.</p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            The unittest class is used when developing the webapp, our project is about using the back-end to analyse the video
            Therefore for most cases, the unit testing is hard to be done by code under the theory of TDD. The reason is that,
            the video output have to be run and checked by human to see the exactly the AI information outline on the video
            is correct which is not static at all, it changes every time by different cases
          </p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            Therefore when we were doing the development, most TDD is done by hand other than code. These unit testing is
            just used to test the whole program can catch up the exception, or can run the video successfully.
            For most functions tested in the unit test is now been disabled for real application, the reason is that
            it is not worth to keep unit tests which cannot cover most cases, everything still need check by hand.
            The unit test by code including user login, logout, run the video reading.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            The following paragraph will discuss how we implement the unit test by hand to build the app and how the integration test we took to see
            the overall performance of the system
          </p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            We are using the integration test to seee the overall performance, especially the accuracy of the web app.
            We found that the accuracy is always low. As said, we stopped by the point to have the dangerous information notification
            system since we find the accuracy is low.
          </p>
          <h2 align="left"><u>Posture Recognition</u></h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" >As we mentioned, using this SDK requires you to have a model. So far, We trained 25 models with different datasets and classifiers. There are three different categories of samples we gathered for generating datasets, one is purely using the image samples from opensource photo library which is showing sitting, standing and laying, the second category is using the photos we took by using camera and the other is having the first two categories together. We found that it is not necessary that the more samples we have, the more accurate AI can be. It really depends on how classifiers calculate the data and the accuracy of the photo samples. However, the sample size has to be greater than 15 in order to process the classification to generate a model.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" >After we got all the models, we use 3 different types of human actions image "sitting" "standing" "laying", and you can see from the right, each type has quantity of three. The testing images are the mixed of opensource photos and the photos we took from camera for testing models. 'y' means successfully recognise the posture, 'n' means failure. 'st' means 'standing', 'si' means 'sitting' and 'la' means 'laying'. The models name labelled at the top are all trained by MLPclassifier. As a result, we found that 'training4' model is the most accurate.</p>

            <div class="column">
              <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">After we selected the model, we used Graident Boosted Tree and Adaboost classifier to generate the models with the same datasets trained for 'training4'. Finally, we compare the accuracy among the three classifiers. As a result, the model generated from MLP classifier has the best overall performance.</p>

          </div>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Although none of the models recognise the standing image, we used another few standing images, the model we selected partly recognised them correctly.</p>

          <h2 align="left"><u>Face Item Recognition</u></h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            We choose a ten-second video to test for the item and face recognition.
            There are two people including in the video with one person has a small knives held by hand.
            We found the face has been nicely detected three time per second accurately within the range of 3 meters
            and the deadly (small knives) never been recognised when it is 5 meters away from the camera. It shows that
            how the AI CCTV far away from the real-world application at the moment.
          </p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            The accuracy and test cases will be discussed further in the following paragraph

The images have the same content but with different resolution, and the same as the video. The reason why we are using 3 secs of video is because the image recognition takes a long time to process, and the problem mostly came from the Posture Recognition. The Posture Recognition analyse each frame from the video, hence, the more resolution you have in the video, the slower you will get from the overall performance.

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">This table shows the overall performance of the real-time posture recognition and face/item recognition. The posture recognition requires large computational processing ability, it would takes 5 seconds at least to read one frame when doing the live-stream and/video. It would be hard to detect the faces since the face recognition requires a smooth and fluent video/live input. When the machine is running the posture recognition, face recognition found hard to recognise the face since too less frames (0.2 frame per second or said 0.2fps ) are fed to the face recognition.

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">We were demonstrating weekly the development of our Recognition API to our TA using the front-end developed for the demo purposes. The presentation was also done to the client during our end of the week meeting.
          This helped us track down the suggestions for improvement made from our TA and complete them accordingly.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Testers</u></h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Our testers were our TA along with the client and some of our coursemates and people on street in order to have a wide variety of opinions for our project. Talking with our classmates
          was really important to take ideas on their approach to the development of our project. Any ideas suggested were taking into consideration with respect to time limit and complexity.</p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
          <!-- <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Test Cases</u></h2> -->
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Feedbacks</u></h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Our TA mentioned that we should add a loading animation while our Recognition API is analysing the input since
          large file take more time to process. Adding this animation would help the user realize that the API is still processing the input and made our UI look more professional. </p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            When we were testing with the street people. Most are excited about that AI CCTV. We uploading their faces pictures by taking a short video and train the data very quickly.
            They has been recognised immediately after that 3 minutes short preparing
          </p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            However, most people are not happy with the posture recognition, the first thing is that it looks a bit useless at the moment since it can only detect sitting, standing and lying down.
            The other feed back given by the testers is that the the posture program is working too slow, it tooks few seconds to process one frame.
          </p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            The tester said they are worry about the sensitivity about the item recognition, since it can only detect the top 5 most significant items within the frame.
            It means that small deadly like pistols or small knives may be ignored by the recognition system.
          </p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
            A really good feedback is that people are shocked by the face recognition, it only takes 3 minuets to take video and analysis faces, then it can work with more than 50%
            accuracy to detect the people in the frames.
