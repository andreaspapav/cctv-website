          <p class="line"></p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" >We separated the technology research areas into four parts, and the first three elements are for the Image Recognition and the last elements are for the integration and deployment:
            <br>
            <br>
            - Posture Recognition
            <br>
            - Face Recognition
            <br>
            - Item Recognition
            <br>
            - System Integration
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Posture Recognition</u></h2>
          <h2 align="left">Openpose</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" >It is an open source library which detects human joints in the image, video or live-video. We first used a desktop machine with GTX1050Ti to install and test the API, and we find out that the openpose displays the track of the human joints for all the people displayed in the image or video, and it also outputs the json file consisting of the x and y coordinates of all the human joints.
            <br>
            <br>
          We can use the x and y body coordinates to generate the posture patterns of 'sitting', 'standing' and 'laying' with tensorflow, then we put it into a dataset in csv.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Tensorflow</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Since our project requires the study of human behaviour pattern in image, so we decided to have a research on TensorFlow based on GPU. We are thinking this open source library will be one of the essential components to link to our image recognition. In more details, we believe this component can help the machine to point out what postures are shown in the image by feeding the information about in what pattern of x and y coordinates can determine what postures it is.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Anaconda</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">This is for creating custom python environment to do the version control. At the start, we are thinking to create three different python environment for posture, item and face recognition to avoid library version collision.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">MLPclassifier</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">It is one of components in one of the python libraries called sklearn. It is a classifier which learns algorithm or functions by training on a dataset. The classifier requires dataset and will generate a PKL file which enables objects to be serialized to files on disk and deserialized back into the program at runtime.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">AdaBoost</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">It is also a classifier,but it is an alternative way to train the machine learning model, and it is used to boost the performance of decision trees on binary classification problems.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Gradient Boosting Trees</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">It is the third classifier we chose to apply on training posture recognition. In terms of the difference from other classifers, it produces decision trees in order to optimise an arbitrary differentiable loss function.</p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>System Integration</u></h2>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: center;" >This section is for integrating AzureVM, image recognition and web application together.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Azure Cloud</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Since this project involves tons of requirements on image recognition and machine learning, we decided to host an GPU based Linux virtual machine from Azure. In addition, after the integration, we can use it for deployment as well since it got an IPv4 address for accessing the web application.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Ubuntu Server User Authentication</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned, we will use Ubuntu server to host the web application and the image recognition. However, the user that will run the apahce web server is not the user that we normally use to login into the server, it is www-data. This research is to investigate how to give essential powers for this particular authority to execute the backend image recognition python file, modifying the linux file system and etc.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Apache</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">The files which we used to write image recognition and machine learning will mainly be written in python. Since we do not have requirement on building fasinating and functional web UI and the application requires extensive communication with the Linux server, we are thinking to use PHP to show our demonstration on our AI.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Mod_wgi</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">It is an potential apache extension which we are going to use in order to communicate with the python files.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Django</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Since most files we implemented for the image recognition are in python, we are also thinking using Django would be a good solution to execute the image recognition from the webserver</p>
          <br>
          <h2 align="left">Navigator.mediaDevices JS library</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the ways to access the webcam from the web application throught JS</p>

          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: center;" >This section will be comparing different technologies in different parts mentioned above.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Posture Recognition</u></h2>
          <h2 align="left">Classifiers</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">As I mentioned above, three classifiers have their own algorithm to create the model. After a few experiment, we found that each of the classifiers might be accurate in different patterns of datasets. Therefore, when we are creating the model for the posture recognition, we will generate three different models from three classifiers, and then we will compare which model is more accurate by inputing sample images displaying 'sitting', 'standing' and 'laying'.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Face Recognition</u></h2>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>Item Recognition</u></h2>
          <h2 class="section-heading text-uppercase"><u>System Integration</u></h2>
          <h2 align="left">Apache & Django</h2>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">Both are webservers, one is mainly for PHP and the other is for python. However, here are the aspects that we have to consider in order to choose which webserver that we are going to use for system integration:</p>
          <br>
            <ul class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>Most image recognition files are in python</li>
              <li>Image webcam screenshot functionality attached to the web application will be in JS</li>
              <li>Application requires communication with Linux server</li>
              <li>Displaying the livefeed video functionality attached to the web application requires Django</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">From situation 1, both webserver can execute python file. Apache can use PHP to run "shell_exec()" function to perform the linux shell command to execute the python file with anaconda environment</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">From situation 2, we can see that PHP has more advantages than using Django because of the library written in JS. Since PHP is like a senior version of HTML, Apache is more compatible.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">From situation 3, the web application allows users to use the image recognition to analyse the image, webcam image, video and live video uploaded. Therefore, the easiest setup for this experiment, is having executable shell command to be integrated into the web application for the www-data user. Therefore, again Apache has more advantages on this.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;">From situation 4, To be continued...</p>

          <h1 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Summary of final decision</h1>
          <p class="line"></p>
          <p class="text-black-100" style="text-align: justify;" > In terms of the image recognition, as you can see that we have already separated into three different parts: posture, item and face recognition. This is because there is no image recognition as a whole package nowadays. We can use posture to identify whether the people is sitting, standing or laying, item to recognise the things surrounding us and face to recognise who this person is. Different recognitions will be implemented by different methods of machine learning and recognition. For the posture recognition, I will be using 3 different classifiers mentioned above in order to compare the accuracy between them and select the best from them. 
            <br>
            <br>
          Since Camden Council monitoring centre has their own UI and the main purpose is to develop the CCTV AI, we decided to use Apache as our main webserver, so that we can save lots of time and contribute more times on developing the CCTV AI. In addition, PHP can communicate with the Linux server easily in order to configure the internal configuration for executing the python files and analysed the different inputs uploaded by the users. The web application will just be used for demonstrating how far we have developed our CCTV AI.</p>
